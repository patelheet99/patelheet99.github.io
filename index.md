## Video Recommendation System
developed a Flask application incorporating machine learning algorithms that provide highly accurate video recommendations. I have successfully applied NLP-based clustering algorithms and preprocessed data using various techniques, resulting in improved processing time and meaningful insights extracted from large datasets.

## Forecasting PM25 Particle
Created a precise forecasting model utilizing FBProphet to predict Delhi's pm25 particle air pollution levels up to one year in advance, achieving an exceptional RMSE value of 0.010 through extensive analysis of data from the Delhi government.Preprocessing of data includes handling missing values, distriution of data. For data visualization, lag plot and seasonal components were plotted. Model training was done using data driven methods, ARIMA, SARIMA and FBProphet.

## YELP Analyzer
Implemented a comprehensive PowerBI dashboard utilizing Yelp dataset of 11GB and integrating with Databricks and Azure Datalake for effective data visualization, resulting in improved insights and decision-making capabilities. 

## FACIAL RECOGNITION-BASED ATTENDANCE SYSTEM
Designed an advanced attendance management system using TensorFlow and Tkinter that enables efficient and accurate attendance tracking. Achieved a measurable improvement in attendance management processes, resulting in a 40% increase in efficiency.

## Food Classification using CNN
Using AlexNet, VGG, ResNet, and transfer learning techniques, a model was developed that achieved high accuracy in classifying images in the food category. The model was able to accurately identify a wide variety of food items with a high degree of precision and recall, demonstrating its effectiveness in recognizing subtle visual differences between similar food items.

### There's a horizontal rule below this.

* * *

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
