## Forecasting PM25 Particle
Created a precise forecasting model utilizing FBProphet to predict Delhi's pm25 particle air pollution levels up to one year in advance, achieving an exceptional RMSE value of 0.010 through extensive analysis of data from the Delhi government.Preprocessing of data includes handling missing values, distriution of data. For data visualization, lag plot and seasonal components were plotted. Model training was done using data driven methods, ARIMA, SARIMA and FBProphet.
